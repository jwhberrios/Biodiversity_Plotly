# Navel Biodiversity Visualization Using Plotly
### Note: Website with itneractive charts to view bacteria profile of volunteers can be accessed by clicking [here.]( https://jwhberrios.github.io/Navel_Biodiversity_Plotly/)

#### Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive website to visualize data of the bacteria profile sampled from the navel of study participants. This bacteria profile could potentially be used by food companies to generate beef flavor for their beef substitute food product.

The following information is presented when a test subject's ID number is chose by clicking on it in the pulldown menu:
1. A gauge graph to reflect how often the navel was washed per week.
2. The top 10 bacteria found is presented in a bar graph. 
3. Bacteria cultures per sample presented in a bubble graph. The size of the bubble reflects the quantity of the specific bacteria culture.

##### Resources
Plotly was used to create the chart visuals.
HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap was used to gather the data and generate the interactive website.
